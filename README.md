# Pets Api

This is an api that is used in Backend Mod 3 exercise for students to explore api tools including Postman and Faraday.

### Versions

Rails 7.2.2

Ruby 3.2.2

## Exercises

1. Using Postman, try to get a successful response from each endpoint.
   - If you haven't installed Postman you can do so [here](https://www.postman.com/product/api-client/)

2. Using Faraday, try to get a successful response from each endpoint.
    - Install the [Faraday gem](https://github.com/lostisland/faraday)
    - Create a ruby file and require the Faraday library along with a debugger, such as [pry](https://github.com/pry/pry)
    - In this newly created Ruby file write requests for each endpoint, use your debugger to check the response body

*Extra Challenge:* Explore how to parse a JSON response [here](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.6.3/libdoc/json/rdoc/JSON.html)
